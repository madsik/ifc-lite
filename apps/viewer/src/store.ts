/**
 * Re-export from modular store for backward compatibility
 *
 * The store has been refactored into domain-specific slices:
 * - loadingSlice: Loading, progress, error state
 * - selectionSlice: Entity and storey selection
 * - visibilitySlice: Hidden/isolated entities, type visibility
 * - uiSlice: Panel state, theme, mobile detection
 * - hoverSlice: Hover and context menu state
 * - cameraSlice: Camera rotation and callbacks
 * - sectionSlice: Section plane state
 * - measurementSlice: Measurements, snapping, edge lock
 * - dataSlice: IFC data and geometry
 *
 * See apps/viewer/src/store/ for the modular implementation.
