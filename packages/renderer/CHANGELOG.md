# @ifc-lite/renderer

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- [#117](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/117) [`4bf4931`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/4bf4931181d1c9867a5f0f4803972fa5a3178490) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix multi-material rendering and enhance CSG operations

  ### Multi-Material Rendering

  - Windows now correctly render with transparent glass panels and opaque frames
  - Doors now render all submeshes including inner framing with correct colors
  - Fixed mesh deduplication in Viewport that was filtering out submeshes sharing the same expressId
  - Added SubMesh and SubMeshCollection types to track per-geometry-item meshes for style lookup

  ### CSG Operations

  - Added union and intersection mesh operations for full boolean CSG support
  - Improved CSG clipping with degenerate triangle removal to eliminate artifacts
  - Enhanced bounds overlap detection for better performance
  - Added cleanup of triangles inside opening bounds to remove CSG artifacts

- [#130](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/130) [`cc4d3a9`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/cc4d3a922869be5d4f8cafd4ab1b84e6bd254302) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add IFC5 federated loading support with layer composition

  ## Features

  - **Federated IFCX Loading**: Load multiple IFCX files that compose into a unified model

    - Supports the IFC5/IFCX Entity-Component-System architecture
    - Later files in the composition chain override earlier files (USD-inspired semantics)
    - Properties from overlay files merge with base geometry files

  - **Models Panel Integration**: Show all federated layers in the Models panel

    - Each layer (base + overlays) displayed as a separate entry
    - Overlay-only files (no geometry) shown with data indicator
    - Toggle visibility per layer

  - **Add Overlay via "+" Button**: Add IFCX overlay files to existing models
    - Works with both single-file and already-federated IFCX models
    - Automatically re-composes with new overlay as strongest layer
    - Preserves original files for future re-composition

  ## Fixes

  - **Property Panel Layout**: Long property strings no longer push other values off-screen

    - Changed from flexbox to CSS grid layout
    - Individual horizontal scroll on each property value

  - **3D Selection Highlighting**: Fixed race condition that broke highlighting after adding overlays

    - Geometry now comes exclusively from models Map (not legacy state)
    - Meshes correctly tagged with modelIndex for multi-model selection

  - **ID Range Tracking**: Fixed maxExpressId calculation for proper entity resolution
    - resolveGlobalIdFromModels now correctly finds entities across federated layers

  ## Technical Details

  - New `LayerStack` class manages ordered composition with strongest-to-weakest semantics
  - New `PathIndex` class enables efficient cross-layer entity lookups
  - `parseFederatedIfcx` function handles multi-file composition
  - Viewer auto-detects when multiple IFCX files are loaded together

- Updated dependencies [[`0c1a262`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0c1a262d971af4a1bc2c97d41258aa6745fef857), [`fe4f7ac`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/fe4f7aca0e7927d12905d5d86ded7e06f41cb3b3), [`4bf4931`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/4bf4931181d1c9867a5f0f4803972fa5a3178490), [`07558fc`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/07558fc4aa91245ef0f9c31681ec84444ec5d80e)]:
